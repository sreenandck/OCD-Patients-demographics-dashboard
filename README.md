# OCD-Patients-demographics-dashboard
The "OCD Patient Dataset: Demographics &amp; Clinical Data" comprises information on 1,500 individuals diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) .  So in this power bi project we aim to analyze and derive insights from the OCD patients clinical data to understand the patients details and their treatment duration and speculations.
Through interactive dashboards and visualization we will provide a detailed overview of demographic details such as age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and education, alongside clinical data like OCD diagnosis date, symptom duration, and previous psychiatric conditions.

# Key objectives of this project are:

Differentiate obsessions and compulsions, and identify common patterns.
## Analyze Severity:
Use Y-BOCS scores to assess symptom severity and correlations.
## Study comorbidity:
Investigate the impact of depression and anxiety on OCD.
## Evaluate Treatments:
Analyze prescribed medications and their effectiveness.
##  Explore Genetics:
Examine family history for hereditary and environmental influences.

Support researchers, clinicians, and mental health professionals with data-driven findings.
